'Population-level' filtering of SNPs = filterSNPs.v2.sh
Calculation of Observed and Expected Heterozygosity = countHo.sh, SiteHe.sh and Ho_He.R
Calculation of % polymorphic loci for various sample size by random resampling = polym_resample.sh
Calculation of average within-site genetic distance (1 - Identity-By-State) = GD.R
Calculation of Expected heterozygosity and % polymorphic loci by chromosome = HeByChr.py and PolymLociByChr.py
